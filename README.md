# Unbreakable stack

## Description
    Realisation of stack for different types with (in future) some safety functions
## Starting
    To work with this stack, you need to include '"stack_unic.h"' in your code, and, to instanse
    stack template, do '#define TYPE type_you_want_to' (now int and double is working), then
'#include "stack_global.h"', then '#include "stack.cpp"'
### Dependences
    Linux, g++, make
### Run
    'make stack' will compile and run test program.
